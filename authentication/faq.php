  "PHP is a server-side scripting language that is used to create dynamic web pages. It stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.",
  "PHP scripts are executed on the server, and the resulting HTML is sent to the client. The client's web browser does not execute the PHP code, but rather displays the HTML produced by the PHP script.",
  "A PHP script is a text file containing a series of PHP commands. It has a .php file extension and is typically saved in the root directory of a web server. When a user requests a PHP page, the server processes the PHP commands and generates the HTML output to be displayed in the user's web browser.",
  "PHP is often used to create web-based applications, such as content management systems, forums, and e-commerce websites. It can also be used to access and manipulate databases, create dynamic images, and perform server-side validation of form data.",
